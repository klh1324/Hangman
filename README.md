##  Contribute 
In order to contribute to the word bank, simply add the guess word in lowercase in the wordlist.txt file, and add a corresponding hint in the hintlist.txt file.

##  Potential Issues
If the ESL option is not diplaying the correct hint, make sure the number of lines in wordlist.txt and hintlist.txt are aligned.
